We are moving forward with the search view project, and I wanted to provide you with the full scope of work. This search page should function like Google Search with additional features, including search history, autocomplete, speed dial (frequently visited sites), and a voice search option.



1️⃣ Reference Site:

I will also provide a Figma design link for UI reference.



2️⃣ Core Functionalities & Features
🔍 Search Bar with Autocomplete & History
✅ The search bar must support dynamic autocomplete, similar to Google.
✅ It should fetch suggestions dynamically from an external source (e.g., Google Suggest API).
✅ When the user types, previous searches should be displayed as suggestions.

✅ Keyboard navigation:
Arrow Down / Arrow Up to navigate history/suggestions.
Enter to select a suggestion and perform a search.
Escape to clear the search bar and hide suggestions.

📌 Frequently Visited Sites (Speed Dial)
✅ A speed dial section should show frequently visited pages.
✅ Default sites should include Wikipedia, YouTube, Facebook, LinkedIn, Gmail, etc.
✅ Users can add, edit, and remove custom sites.
✅ Icons should be fetched from DuckDuckGo’s favicon service.
✅ This list should be stored in localStorage.



🎤 Voice Search (Speech-to-Text)
✅ The search page should support speech-to-text functionality using webkitSpeechRecognition.
✅ Clicking the microphone icon will allow users to speak their query, which will be automatically inserted into the search bar.
✅ Only works in Chrome-based browsers.



🔄 Search Query Redirection
✅ When a user searches, the site should redirect the query to a specific URL format.
✅ Additional parameters (fs = fetch start time, rs = response start time) should be included in the URL.
✅ The site should track the last searched query using sessionStorage.



⚙️ Google Services Dropdown
✅ A dropdown menu should provide quick access to:
Gmail
Google Drive
Google Translate
Google Maps
Google Calendar
Google Docs, Sheets, Slides, and Earth

✅ The dropdown should open on button click and close when clicking outside.
🛠️ Performance & Browser Tracking
✅ The page should collect browser and platform details (OS, architecture, version) and store them as cookies.
✅ Uses navigator.userAgentData.getHighEntropyValues for tracking.



📑 Additional Features
✅ Search history should be stored locally (in localStorage).
✅ Users should be able to clear search history.
✅ Clicking outside dropdowns/suggestions should close them.
✅ The search input should reset on page reload.



3️⃣ Design & Code Variation Requirements
Since we are developing multiple versions of this page, every instance should be unique in its codebase:
✅ Each version must have a different HTML structure, CSS styles, and slight JavaScript differences to avoid similarity detection.
✅ UI variations (e.g., color scheme, layout adjustments) should be included.
✅ The page must be fully responsive for desktop users (no mobile required).



4️⃣ Technical Requirements
✅ Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (you can choose the framework or use vanilla JS).
✅ Must be lightweight and optimized for fast performance.
✅ No unnecessary external dependencies unless required.



5️⃣ Deliverables & Timeline
📌 Each search page should be delivered independently for review.
📌 Estimated time & cost per page?
📌 How soon can we get the first version of one page as a proof of concept?
